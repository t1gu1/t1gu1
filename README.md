### Always love learning new things!

- My favorite programming language of the moment was dart/[Flutter](https://flutter.dev)⚡, not so long ago.
- Recently I learn a lot of Godot and they gdscript. (Looks a lot like Python)
- At the moment i'm a lot in the `nvim` world and learning more about `.lua`. (I love so much the Vim motions)

Developer by profession, Gamer by Hobby, usually love to explore try things in my Free Time as I'm a **Tech Enthusiasm**! :)
