### Always love learning new things!

- My favorite programming language is javascript/typescript
- Recently I learn a lot of Godot and they gdscript. (Looks a lot like Python)
- At the moment i'm a lot in the `nvim` world and learning more about `.lua`. (I love so much the Vim motions)
- Also, i'm a pro of react-native and make it works multiplatform!

Developer by profession, Gamer by Hobby, usually love to explore try things in my Free Time as I'm a **Tech Enthusiasm**! :)

- ⚡️ Fun-Facts I always say "Hey hey" to salute someone and yeah, that's me on the gif up there.
- 💻 I’m "currently working" on a nice personal project using a NativeWind like approach(But custom) that use React-native and Expo.
- 🌱 I’m currently making a nice tournament app and develloping a multiplayer game :)
- ⚙️ I use daily: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `tailwind`, `astro`, `.lua` (And many many more, but these my favorites)
- 💻 I work a lot with `React/next.js`, `react-native/expo`, `node.js` & `nest.js` in my general professional occupation.
- 🎨 I'm not a UI/UX designer by profession, but after all my years of experience, i'm kind of.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I am happy to help

  👋 Hope you do well and don't hesitate to talk with me if you have any question
